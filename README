# Ifkarsyah Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for various development tools and environments. It is designed to be portable and easy to set up on new machines.

Each folder contains configuration files arranged so that the paths **mirror their target locations** in your home directory.

## Installation

### 1. Install GNU Stow

```bash
brew install stow
```
### 2. Install this Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ifkarsyah/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
```

### 3. Stow your dotfiles
```bash
stow git
stow shell
stow vim
stow vscode
stow ssh
stow docker
```

✅ This will create symlinks in your home directory pointing to the files in this repository.

For example:
```bash
~/.gitconfig -> ~/dotfiles/git/.gitconfig
~/.zshrc -> ~/dotfiles/shell/.zshrc
~/.vimrc -> ~/dotfiles/vim/.vimrc
~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json -> ~/dotfiles/vscode/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
~/.ssh/config -> ~/dotfiles/ssh/.ssh/config
~/.docker/config.json -> ~/dotfiles/docker/.docker/config.json
```

### 4. Undo / remove a stowed folder
If you want to remove the symlinks created by Stow:
```bash
stow -D git
stow -D vim
```
This removes the symlinks without touching the repository files.
